    <p>Brian Jason, a SF Bay Area native, has worked in sales, technical support and customer care since 2007.

In his current position, as a Regional Sales Rep, Brian is having a great time meeting new people, learning about their lives and helping them grow their businesses. In 2012, he made the leap from customer care and technical support to sales. He set out with the belief that his new career would allow him to learn a valuable set of skills, benefiting him professionally throughout his lifetime â€” which is exactly what happened.

While previously working in Technical Support, the experience taught him the importance of thinking in a systematic way and that any problem can be solved with the right approach. He also discovered the power of data analysis and the amazing things that can be done with data.

Brian is a life long technology geek, tinkerer, a lover of history and a people-person. Highly tech savvy, he has an insatiable thirst for learning about the latest advancements in science and technology. His greatest desire is to be known for asking good questions and being a good thinker.</p>
